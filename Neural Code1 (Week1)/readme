# **Week 1: Neural Coding**

## Introduction

In the first week of this course, we will explore the process by which information is represented and transmitted by neurons in the brain, known as neural coding. We will focus on how the presence of noise in neural circuits affects the encoding and processing of information, and how cortical circuits organize themselves to minimize the impact of noise.

### Readings
**The following papers are recommended for this week's readings:**

* Noise, neural codes and cortical organization by Michael N Shadlen and William T Newsome

* Is there a signal in the noise? by Michael N Shadlen and William T Newsome

* The Highly Irregular Firing of Cortical Cells Is Inconsistent with Temporal Integration of Random EPSPs

* Simple codes versus efficient codes by William R Softky

### Topics
During this week, we will cover the following topics:

* **Noise in neural circuits**
We will discuss how the presence of noise in neural circuits affects the encoding and processing of information. We will examine how neurons can extract useful information from noisy inputs, and how cortical circuits organize themselves to minimize the impact of noise on information processing. Students will learn about the various mechanisms that neurons use to filter out noise and extract useful information, such as adaptation, correlation-based coding, and temporal coding.

* **Probabilistic computations**
We will discuss how neurons integrate and interpret noisy signals, and how they use probabilistic computations to make decisions based on uncertain information. Students will learn about the concept of "neural variability", which refers to the fact that individual neurons can produce different responses to the same stimulus. The paper explores how neural variability can be used to improve the accuracy of information processing, and how it can be modulated by attention and other cognitive factors.

* **Firing patterns of cortical neurons**
We will examine the firing patterns of cortical neurons and how they are affected by the stochastic nature of synaptic inputs. The paper argues that the highly irregular firing patterns of cortical neurons are inconsistent with the idea that they integrate random EPSPs over time, and suggests that other mechanisms, such as coincidence detection, may be responsible for neural coding in the cortex. Students will learn about the different models of neural coding that have been proposed, and how they can be tested experimentally.

* **Optimization of neural codes**
We will discuss the trade-off between neural codes that are simple and easy to interpret, versus codes that are more efficient and minimize the use of neural resources. The paper argues that the brain uses efficient codes to represent sensory information, and that these codes are optimized to match the statistical properties of the environment. Students will learn about the different criteria that can be used to evaluate neural codes, such as sparseness, selectivity, and decorrelation.

### Conclusion
By the end of this week, students will have gained a comprehensive understanding of neural coding, and how it is affected by noise, cortical organization, and the statistical properties of the environment. They will learn about the different models of neural coding, and how they can be tested experimentally using techniques such as electrophysiology and imaging.
